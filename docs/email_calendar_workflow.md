# Gmail & Calendar Workflow

Purpose: Use Gmail + Calendar inputs to plan Diego’s days. Summaries are sent **only when requested**.

## Gmail (read‑only)
- Search, read, and summarize inbox threads
- No email sending unless explicitly requested
- Drafts allowed only when asked

## Calendar (read‑only)
- Read upcoming events (next 24–48h)
- Identify schedule conflicts, travel gaps, and prep time

## Daily summary (on request)
- Summarize:
  - urgent emails
  - key calendar events
  - critical Todoist items
- Provide a proposed plan / focus list

## Logging
- Audit actions to `memory/agent-audit.log`
